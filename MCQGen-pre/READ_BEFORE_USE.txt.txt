Instructions: Run everything from top to bottom.

Pros:
The flow is indeed working. 
The bot has stopped whenever it gives a question for the user, and it also does not move on 
to the next question until the right answer has been input.
The bot is processing the questions in a correct order, from asking about the statements to asking about the paragraph.

Cons:
The flow isn't finished, as the comparison and the T/F/NG part is not finished.
The bot doesn't automatically asks questions like it was supposed do. The way to make it follow the steps is to ask it to follow the steps it was given.
The options are not formatted correctly and are connected.
The options are heavily halluncinated, and will be worked on.
The explanations for each options aren't really good, and will be worked on in the future.
